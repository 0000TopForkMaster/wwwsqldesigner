# Installation
You will need to install WWW SQL Designer if you want to:
  * Use custom locale
  * Use custom CSS file
  * Use custom DB definition
  * Use custom server backend

Just [download](http://code.google.com/p/wwwsqldesigner/downloads/list) and unpack latest application archive. There are generally no requirements, but to use server-side storage, one should have a working webserver.
